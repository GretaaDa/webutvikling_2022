          <h2>UD vs SEO</h2>
          <p>
            All websites chase the goal of success. But to actually become
            successful, the website needs to reach out to a bigger variety of
            people. There are two methods that can be implemented into your
            website that can help out with your goal; universal design (UD) and
            search engine optimization (SEO). This article will explore the two
            processes and will look into how they can be implemented and
            beneficial for your web development.
          </p>
          <h3>Universal Design</h3>
          <p>
            Universal design is not the first thing that pops up to a
            developer's head. But it can be a big issue later in time. UD is a
            process used to develop environments or products that can be
            accessed by people with special abilities, disabilities and various
            age groups. By taking these groups into consideration, the website
            becomes user friendly to the maximum number of users.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best technique to use, when implementing universal design into
            web developing, is by following the 7 recommended principles:

          <h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
          <p>
            Search engine optimization is different from UD, since it deals with
            the website's traffic, instead of its design. SEO is used to improve
            the ranking of a website on a search engine, such as Google,
            depending on its content relevance. With the help of algorithms,
            search engines can evaluate the popularity of the links, keywords
            and even the structure used in your code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since web development is becoming more accessible for more people ,
            it can be difficult to compete with other websites on the world wide
            web. By using SEO it can increase your chances for people to see
            your web page, when searching up a relative topic. Here are a few
            tips that can help you rank higher on the search engine:
