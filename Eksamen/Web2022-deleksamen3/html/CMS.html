          <h2>CMS</h2>
          <p>
            CMS is a term that most are familiar with today. It stands for
            content management system and is widely known for its ability to
            help users manage their digital content without specialized
            technical knowledge. There are two types of CMS - traditional and
            headless. Traditional CMS has a monolithic structure, where the
            backend (database) and the frontend (user interface) are tied
            together. While headless CMS is not connected to the frontend
            directly, it uses API (application programing interface). Both of
            the types are valuable depending on your goal, but how do you know
            which software is optimal for you?
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a whole variety of CMS applications to choose from, but you
            need to know the differences between the two main types before that.
            In this article we will be looking at the differences of the
            traditional CMS and the headless CMS types. We will explore a couple
            examples of the CMS solutions that are out there on the web.
          </p>
          <p>
            Traditional CMS has been around since the start of web development.
            While it is still being used to this current day, it is more
            appealing to small business owners, than bigger companies. You may
            have already heard of a couple well known CMS solutions - WordPress,
            Dupal, Sitecore. These platforms are known for its simple usability,
            and that it is accessible for everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since traditional CMS is a monolith, it allows all of the website's
            contents to be stored in a database, while at the same time you can
            choose the design you want to display the contents in. This type of
            CMS is based a lot around templates and plug-ins, to help the user
            get the right web page outline, while customizing around its
            design.The biggest downside of traditional CMS, is that it has
            limited flexibility and is mostly focused around websites.
          </p>
          <p>
            Unlike the traditional CMS, headless CMS has no direct contact with
            frontend. Traditional CMS stores all the necessary contents and
            allows API to display them on whatever screen or electronic device
            the company wants to run it on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although headless CMS uses up more time and money, it opens a bigger
            window for growth and makes adjusting to developing technology
            easier. With softwares like Sanity and Contentful companies can
            achieve customer-first experiences, with a bit of help from a person
            that can work their way in developing.

            To find the right CMS software you need to identify your goal. If
            you're focused purely on building a website, then by using a
            traditional CMS solution you can definitely achieve that. And if you
            want to have more customizable applications that reach out to more
            people, then a headless software is a fit for you.
